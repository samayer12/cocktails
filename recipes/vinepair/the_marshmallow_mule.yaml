steps:
  - step:
      To make the cocktail, in a tall glass filled with ice, add the vodka and syrup.
  - step:
      Top with soda water and gently stir.
  - step:
      Squeeze in lime wedges to taste.
  - step:
      Stick your garnish marshmallow onto a long toothpick.
  - step:
      Light it on fire, blow it out, then stick the toothpick into the cocktail, marshmallow side out of the drink, to garnish.
  - step:
      To make the syrup, toast the marshmallows over dying embers until they are dark brown and melted inside.
  - step:
      Put them into a heavy-bottomed pot and add the sugar and water.
  - step:
      Slowly bring to a boil, stirring frequently to dissolve the sugar and the marshmallows.
  - step:
      Once you reach a gentle boil, turn the heat down to a simmer and continue cooking and stirring until the marshmallows have dissolved.
  - step:
      Remove the syrup from the heat, stir in the ginger, and transfer to a heatproof container.
  - step:
      Cover and allow to cool overnight.
  - step:
      The next day, strain the syrup through a fine-mesh strainer lined with cheesecloth. The syrup will keep in a tightly sealed container in the fridge for at least 2 weeks.
