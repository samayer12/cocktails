steps:
  - step:
      Add ice to a Highball glass, then pour in the whisky, sherry, and syrup.
  - step:
      Stir to chill ingredients, and top with more ice if needed.
  - step:
      Top with soda water and lightly agitate with a bar spoon to integrate the bubbles.
  - step:
      Garnish with a lemon or grapefruit twist.
  - step:
      Use a vegetable peeler to remove the zest from the grapefruit, avoiding as much of the white pith as possible.
  - step:
      Combine sugar with the grapefruit zest and rosemary in a bowl. Toss to coat the peels and distribute them evenly through the sugar.
  - step:
      Place the mixture in a vacuum bag (or ziplock) and seal the bag. Let the mixture sit at room temperature for up to 24 hours, or until the sugar is dissolved by the grapefruit oil.
  - step:
      Strain the grapefruit oil into a container and store in the refrigerator for up to two weeks. (Note: can also add ½ cup boiling water to the mix before straining to increase yield.)
