  - step:
      While your grill is hot, place the orange slices on the grill.
  - step:
      Allow orange slices to cook undisturbed for about 3 minutes, until grill marks have appeared, then flip and grill for about another 3 minutes until the second side is also showing grill marks.

      Take the orange slices off the grill and set them aside to cool for about 10 minutes.
  - step:
      Put the orange slices in a cup, add the sugar, and gently press the sugar and fruit together to start dissolving the sugar in the juices.

      Add the wine and a generous scoop of crushed ice or small ice cubes from your cooler.
  - step:
      Use a spoon to churn the ingredients and the ice up and down in the glass for about 20 seconds.
