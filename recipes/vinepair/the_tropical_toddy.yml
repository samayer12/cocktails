      Garnish with a wide swath of lemon zest, studded with cloves. (Esquire Tavern’s bartenders light the cloves with a match and express the lemon peel over the drink while the cloves burn out. Feel free to garnish without the pyrotechnics, if you're feeling less ambitious.)

  - step:
      When the mixture starts to steam, and feels hot if you hold your hand several inches above the surface of the liquid, remove from heat.

      Let cool before using.
